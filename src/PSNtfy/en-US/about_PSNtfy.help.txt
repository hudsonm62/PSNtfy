SYNOPSIS
    PSNtfy is a PowerShell module for sending notifications via the PSNtfy service.

LONG DESCRIPTION

Ntfy is a Go-based notification service that allows users to send
notifications to their devices using an API. PSNtfy is a PowerShell
module that provides cmdlets to interact with the Ntfy service, enabling
users to build and send notifications directly from PowerShell in a
simple and efficient manner.

PSNtfy supports nearly all the features of the Ntfy service, including
Authentication, File attachments and more. It is designed to be easy to
use, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced PowerShell
users who want to integrate notification capabilities into their scripts
and workflows quickly without needing to learn complex APIs.

EXAMPLES

    Example 1: Send a basic notification

    PS/> Send-NtfyPush -NtfyEndpoint 'https://ntfy.sh' -Topic "mytopic" `
             -Body "Hello, Ntfy!"

    This command sends a simple notification with the message "Hello, Ntfy!"
    to the topic "mytopic".

    Example 2: Send a notification with additional options

    PS/> Send-NtfyPush -NtfyEndpoint 'https://ntfy.sh' -Topic "alerts" `
        -Priority "high" -Tags @("fire", "server") -Sound "alert" `
        -Body "Server CPU usage is high!" -Title "Alert on SERVER01"

    This command sends a high-priority notification with tags and a sound
    to the topic "alerts".

    Example 3: Send a notification to a protected topic with authentication
    PS/> $Token = ConvertTo-SecureString "tk_***" -AsPlainText -Force
    PS/> Send-NtfyPush -AccessToken $Token -NtfyEndpoint 'https://ntfy.sh' `
            -Topic "SecureTopic" -Body "A notification with authentication!"

    This command sends a notification to a protected topic "SecureTopic"
    using an access token for authentication.

    By default the token uses "Bearer" authentication. You can also use the
    '-Credential' parameter to supply a PSCredential object for Basic auth if needed.
